Use the `rect(x,y,w,h)` function to tell the computer to display a rectangle. The first argument sets the `x` position of the top-left corner, the second argument sets the `y` position, the third argument sets the width of the rectangle, and the fourth argument sets the height.

::code{src="TODO:"}

If you use `0` for the `x` and `y` coordinates, the rectangle will appear in the top-left corner of the window. Positive `y` values place the shape closer to the bottom of the window, which is opposite from what you might expect. The `x` argument works normally (`0` puts the shape on the left edge of the window, larger positive values place it to the right).
